# Setup

First in a terminal window (or cmd for windows) run `git clone https://github.com/jeb1399/AntiDDoS.js.git`

For windows users just download this ENTIRE repository and save it as a .zip then extract and run the setup.bat file

For linux users do the same but instead open the terminal and run `chmod -x setup.sh` and then run `./setup.sh`
